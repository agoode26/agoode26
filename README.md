- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @agoode26
- ðŸ‘€ I love Marketing Operations! 
I have spent 7+ years championing Marketing Operations in high growth technology organizations. 
I'm fluent in email marketing, marketing automation, business process enablement, and end-to-end platform implementation and migration. 

I am definitely an optimist. I am enthusiastic, energetic, and highly curious. Iâ€™m always trying to learn new skills and find areas of improvement. I thrive on constructive criticism and I actively seek it out. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python
